				<h1>About</h1>

				<p>
					Study Guide helps you to pre-plan and organize your reading material and time. The utility of Study Guide includes assignment remainder, due date alert, notes and other significant student necessities. Being undergraduate students, we found it difficult to adjust appropriately with intermittent subjects. It would be easier and reliable, if an application helped us remind and keep up with the syllabus. The sole purpose of this software is to assist students with time management and comprehensive study.
