The utility of Study Guide includes assignment remainder, due date alert, attendance record and other significant student necessities.

It would be easier and reliable, if an application helped us remind and keep up with the syllabus. The sole purpose of this software is to assist students with time management and comprehensive study. We intent to use client side JavaScript language, along with HTML and CSS to create an attractive user-friendly visual schema. JavaScript will be used to modernize our website with interactivity.
